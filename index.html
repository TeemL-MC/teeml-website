		<div class="center" style="margin:0 5rem; font-size: 1.1rem; font-style: italic;">
			Hey, thanks for checking us out! I've proudly been in charge of TeemL since its inception.
			It's a wonderful place to come together and help each other out to all get our servers the best that they can.
			I've made some great relationships with some wonderful and skilled people, as well as contributing to group projects.
			TeemL isn't just about productivity, however - it's a great place to talk with like-minded people and enjoy time away from servers.
			Feel free to join our Discord server and have a chat!
