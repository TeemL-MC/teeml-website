TeemL Privacy Policy
Version 1, written 1 Sep 2020

----
INTRODUCTION
----

TeemL takes data privacy very seriously. This document aims to outline what data we store, and what we use it for, when you and/or your staff team makes use of TeemL services.
TeemL is based in the United Kingdom, and as a result, all our data handling is compliant with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. Whilst we do attempt to be compliant with other international regulations, this is not guaranteed.


----
KEY TERMS
----

UUID - universally-unique identifier - an identifier associated, in the context used throughout this document, with a Minecraft: Java Edition account
Discord tag - an identifier associated with a Discord account
Member server - an organisation, part of TeemL, that participates in the development and upkeep of public Minecraft: Java Edition servers
Group staff / network staff - a staff member that holds a role as part of TeemL directly. These roles are always prefixed with "Group"


----
WHAT WE COLLECT
----

- We collect your Minecraft: Java Edition universally-unique identifier and username, and your rank on your member server(s). 
- We collect your Discord tag, only if manually provided by the account holder. Discord tags are only held for group staff. 


----
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR DATA
----

Your member server provides TeemL directly with most of the data we store. This is mostly done automatically, which occurs:
- when you connect to your member server whilst your account holds a staff rank;
- when a synchronisation is forced by a staff member on the member server whilst your account holds a staff rank;
- (in exceptional circumstances) manually by group staff in order to rectify errors caused by technical issues.

- Data may also be indirectly collected from our Discord server. You will be informed before any data from this source is processed.


----
HOW WE STORE YOUR DATA
----

- TeemL stores your data securely on a server in Miami, Florida, USA, operated by Endercraft, a member server. This server is regularly audited to ensure the system is kept secure.
- Data provided to us will be stored for the length of time that you are a member of staff on a member server, after which it will be automatically deleted.


----
HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
----

We use your data to provide an API. This API is used officially in (note this list is not exhaustive and is liable to change):
- the TeemL website, located at https://teeml.net, in order to provide public staff lists;
- providing partner ranks on other member servers.

- The API requires the use of HTTPS (website encryption), and is secure as a result.


----
HANDLING DATA OF THOSE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE
----

- Data of those under 13 years of age is handled according to the COPPA Act.
- Parental permission to handle data of those under 13 is mostly handled by member servers providing the data. However, in the case that this has not happened, TeemL will aim to rectify this as soon as possible. 


----
CONTACTING TEEML
----

Any queries may be directed towards TeemL's nominated data protection officer, Lucy Poulton, whom can be contacted at:
- the email address lucy@teeml.net;
- the Discord user __lucyy#9283.

- Any queries made will be responded to within a reasonable time frame.


----
UPDATES TO THIS POLICY
----

- TeemL reserves the right to update this privacy policy at any time, without prior notice.
- Should the above occur, you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible.
